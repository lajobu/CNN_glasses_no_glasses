The purpose of this project is to create a `Machine Learning model` which will be able to `classify` different kind of images in two groups, `glasss` and `no glasses`. 

The model is based on `Tensorflow/Learn/Tutorials/Images/Transfer learning and fine-tuning` - https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorialsÂ¶

## Technical details about thje project:

 :round_pushpin: **Programming language:** `Python`
