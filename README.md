The purpose of this project is to create a `Machine Learning model` which will be able to `classify` different kind of images in two groups, `glasss` and `no glasses`. In this model it would be applied a pretrained model `MobileNet V2`, developed by google, and it will be applied `fine-tuning` with the weight of the pretrained model.

The model is based on `Tensorflow/Learn/Tutorials/Images/Transfer learning and fine-tuning` - https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorialsÂ¶
